  # A vCard, a specialization of a directory info object.
  #
  # The vCard format is specified by:
  # - RFC2426: vCard MIME Directory Profile (vCard 3.0)
  # - RFC2425: A MIME Content-Type for Directory Information
  #
  # This implements vCard 3.0, but it is also capable of decoding vCard 2.1.
  #
  # For information about:
  # - link:rfc2426.txt: vCard MIME Directory Profile (vCard 3.0)
  # - link:rfc2425.txt: A MIME Content-Type for Directory Information
  # - http://www.imc.org/pdi/pdiproddev.html: vCard 2.1 Specifications
  #
  # vCards are usually transmitted in files with <code>.vcf</code>
  # extensions.
  #
  # TODO - an open question is what exactly "vcard 2.1" support means. While I
  # decode vCard 2.1 correctly, I don't encode it. Should I implement a
  # transcoder, to vCards can be decoded from either version, and then written
  # to either version? Maybe an option to Field#encode()?
  #
  # TODO - there are very few methods that Vcard has that DirectoryInfo
  # doesn't. I could probably just do away with it entirely, but I suspect
  # that there are methods that could be usefully added to Vcard, perhaps to
  # get the email addresses, or the name, or perhaps to set fields, like
  # email=. What would be useful?
  #
  # = Example
  #
  # Here's an example of encoding a simple vCard using the low-level API:
  #
  #   card = Vpim::Vcard.create
  #   card << Vpim::DirectoryInfo::Field.create('email', user.name@example.com, 'type' => "internet" )
  #   card << Vpim::DirectoryInfo::Field.create('url', "http://www.example.com/user" )
  #   card << Vpim::DirectoryInfo::Field.create('fn', "User Name" )
  #   puts card.to_s
  #
  # New! Use the Vpim::Maker::Vcard to make vCards!
  class Vcard < DirectoryInfo

    private_class_method :new

    # Create a vCard 3.0 object with the minimum required fields, plus any
    # +fields+ you want in the card (they can also be added later).
    def Vcard.create(fields = [] )
      fields.unshift Field.create('VERSION', "3.0")
      super(fields, 'VCARD')
    end

    # Decode a collection of vCards into an array of Vcard objects.
    #
    # +card+ can be either a String or an IO object.
    #
    # Since vCards are self-delimited (by a BEGIN:vCard and an END:vCard),
    # multiple vCards can be concatenated into a single directory info object.
    # They may or may not be related. For example, AddressBook.app (the OS X
    # contact manager) will export multiple selected cards in this format.
    #
    # Input data will be converted from unicode if it is detected. The heuristic
    # is based on the first bytes in the string:
    # - 0xEF 0xBB 0xBF: UTF-8 with a BOM, the BOM is stripped
    # - 0xFE 0xFF: UTF-16 with a BOM (big-endian), the BOM is stripped and string
    #   is converted to UTF-8
    # - 0xFF 0xFE: UTF-16 with a BOM (little-endian), the BOM is stripped and string
    #   is converted to UTF-8
    # - 0x00 'B' or 0x00 'b': UTF-16 (big-endian), the string is converted to UTF-8
    # - 'B' 0x00 or 'b' 0x00: UTF-16 (little-endian), the string is converted to UTF-8
    #
    # If you know that you have only one vCard, then you can decode that
    # single vCard by doing something like:
    #
    #   vcard = Vcard.decode(card_data).first
    #

    # the same format?

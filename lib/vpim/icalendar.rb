     it mean? It seems to be when the icalendar was actually created (as opposed to when the user entered
     the information into the calendar database, for example), but in that case my Apple icalendars should
     have all components having the same DTSTAMP, but they don't!

     dur-second = 1*DIGIT "S"

     The EBNF is complicated, because they want to say that /some/ component
     must be present, and that if you have a "T", you need a time after it,
     and that you can't have an hour followed by seconds with no intervening
     minutes... but we don't care about that during decoding, so we rewrite
     the EBNF as:

     dur-value = ["+" / "-"] "P" [ 1*DIGIT "W" ] [ 1*DIGIT "D" ] [ "T" [ 1*DIGIT "H" ]  [ 1*DIGIT "M" ] [ 1*DIGIT "S" ] ]

VEVENT Ifx:

  TEXT: summary, description, comment, location, uid

  think about:  uid

  Vevent#status -> The status, upper-case.
  Vevent#status= -> set a new status, only allow the defined statuses!
  Vevent#status?(s) -> check if the status is s

  can contain alarms... should it include an alarms module?

  # An iCalendar.
  #
  # A Calendar is some meta-information followed by a sequence of components.
  #
  # Defined components are Event, Todo, Freebusy, Journal, and Timezone, each
  # of which are represented by their own class, though they share many
  # properties in common. For example, Event and Todo may both contain
  # multiple Alarm components.
  #
  # = Reference
  #
  # The iCalendar format is specified by a series of IETF documents:
  #
  # - link:rfc2445.txt: Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification
  # - link:rfc2446.txt: iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol
  #   (iTIP) Scheduling Events, BusyTime, To-dos and Journal Entries
  # - link:rfc2447.txt: iCalendar Message-Based Interoperability Protocol
  #
  # iCalendar (RFC 2445) is based on vCalendar, but does not appear to be
  # altogether compatible. iCalendar files have VERSION:2.0 and vCalendar have
  # VERSION:1.0.  While much appears to be similar, the recurrence rule syntax,
  # at least, is completely different.
  #
  # iCalendars are usually transmitted in files with <code>.ics</code>
  # extensions.

When used with ATTENDEE, the parameters are:
  CN
  CUTYPE
  DELEGATED-FROM
  DELEGATED-TO
  DIR
  LANGUAGE
  MEMBER
  PARTSTAT
  ROLE
  RSVP
  SENT-BY

When used with ORGANIZER, the parameters are:
  CN
  DIR
  LANGUAGE
  SENT-BY


What I've seen in Notes invitations, and iCal responses:
  ROLE
  PARTSTAT
  RSVP
  CN

Support these last 4, for now.

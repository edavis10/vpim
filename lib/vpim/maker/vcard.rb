    # A helper class to assist in building a vCard.

    # - link:ex_mkvcard.txt: example of creating a vCard
    # - link:ex_cpvcard.txt: example of copying and them modifying a vCard
    # - link:ex_mkv21vcard.txt: example of creating version 2.1 vCard
    # - link:ex_mkyourown.txt: example of adding support for new fields to Maker::Vcard
    class Vcard
      # Make a vCard.
      #
      # Yields +maker+, a Vpim::Maker::Vcard which allows fields to be added to
      # +card+, and returns +card+, a Vpim::Vcard.
      #
      # If +card+ is nil or not provided a new Vpim::Vcard is created and the
      # fields are added to it.
      #
      # Defaults:
      # - vCards must have both an N and an FN field, #make2 will fail if there
      #   is no FN field in the +card+ when your block is finished adding fields.
      # - If there is an FN field, but no N field, N will be set from the information
      #   in FN, see Vcard::Name#preformatted for more information.
      # - vCards must have a VERSION field. If one does not exist when your block is
      #   is finished adding fields then it will be set to 3.0.

      # - "sip" indicates to use SIP/SIMPLE, RFC 3261

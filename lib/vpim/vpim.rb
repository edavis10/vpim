#:main:Vpim
#:title:vpim - a library to manipulate vCards and iCalendars

#
# vCard (RFC 2426) is a format for personal information, see Vpim::Vcard and
# Vpim::Maker::Vcard.
#
# iCalendar (RFC 2445) is a format for calendar related information, see
# Vpim::Icalendar.
#
# iCalendar was called vCalendar pre-IETF standardization, and since both of
# these "v-formats" are commonly used for personal information management, the
# library is called "vpim".
#
# vCard and iCalendar support is built on top of an implementation of the MIME
# Content-Type for Directory Information (RFC 2425). The basic RFC 2425 format
# is implemented by  Vpim::DirectoryInfo and Vpim::DirectoryInfo::Field.
#
# The libary is quite useable, but there is always more that could be done.
# Since I have a more on my todo list than I have time, if you think something
# is missing or have API suggestions, please contact me. I can't promise
# instantaneous turnaround, but I might be able to suggest another approach,
# and features requested by users of vPim are high priority for me.

#
# = Examples
# 
# Sample utilities are provided as examples of using vPim in samples/.
# 
# vCard examples are:
# - link:ex_mkvcard.txt: example of creating a vCard
# - link:ex_cpvcard.txt: example of copying and them modifying a vCard
# - link:ex_mkv21vcard.txt: example of creating version 2.1 vCard
# - link:mutt-aliases-to-vcf.txt: convert a mutt aliases file to vCards
# - link:ex_get_vcard_photo.txt: pull photo data from a vCard
# - link:ab-query.txt: query the OS X Address Book to find vCards
# - link:vcf-to-mutt.txt: query vCards for matches, output in formats useful
#   with Mutt (see link:README.mutt for details)
# - link:tabbed-file-to-vcf.txt: convert a tab-delimited file to vCards, a
#   (small but) complete application contributed by Dane G. Avilla, thanks!
# - link:vcf-to-ics.txt: example of how to create calendars of birthdays from vCards
# - link:vcf-dump.txt: utility for dumping contents of .vcf files
# 
# iCalendar examples are:
# - link:ics-to-rss.txt: prints todos as RSS, or starts a WEBrick servlet
#   that publishes todos as a RSS feed. Thanks to Dave Thomas for this idea,
#   from http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Blog/ToDos.rdoc.
# - link:cmd-itip.txt: prints emailed iCalendar invitations in human-readable
#   form, and see link:README.mutt for instruction on mutt integration. I get
#   a lot of meeting invitations from Lotus Notes/Domino users at work, and
#   this is pretty useful in figuring out where and when I am supposed to be.
# - link:reminder.txt: prints upcoming events and todos, by default from
#   Apple's iCal calendars
# - link:rrule.txt: utility for printing recurrence rules
# - link:ics-dump.txt: utility for dumping contents of .ics files

  # Either argument can be nil, where nil compares not equal to anything other
  # than nil.

  # This is available both as a module function:
  #   Vpim::Methods.casecmp?("yes", "YES")

  #   include Vpim::Methods
  #   casecmp?("yes", "YES")

  # optimizing for it.

        # This property defines the access classification for a calendar
        # component.
        #
        # An access classification is only one component of the general
        # security system within a calendar application. It provides a method
        # of capturing the scope of the access the calendar owner intends for
        # information within an individual calendar entry. The access
        # classification of an individual iCalendar component is useful when
        # measured along with the other security components of a calendar
        # system (e.g., calendar user authentication, authorization, access
        # rights, access role, etc.). Hence, the semantics of the individual
        # access classifications cannot be completely defined by this memo
        # alone. Additionally, due to the "blind" nature of most exchange
        # processes using this memo, these access classifications cannot serve
        # as an enforcement statement for a system receiving an iCalendar
        # object.  Rather, they provide a method for capturing the intention of
        # the calendar owner for the access to the calendar component.

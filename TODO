Is there a way to see if a vCard field is preferred, using the high-level APIs?

Output a graph of the connections in address book, spouses, etc.

ical2 support

vpim rrule encoding APIs

tzinfo.rubyforge.org

cal.protocol = 

def note=() - removes all the current notes and replaces with this one?

Change to major.minor.buildno?

Use standard Enumerator instead of mine.

Move stuff out of Vpim, so you can do "include Vpim" and not overly pollute
your namespace.

Reorganize Property => Get, add Set

  lib/vpim/ics/set/
  lib/vpim/ics/get/

Adjust CSS stylesheet so that modules show up on single lines?

rename examples:

  ex_ics_...
  ex_vcf_...

vcf example on web page:

  create
  change
  access

ditto for ics

sync vCard encoding types with decoding, and create EVERY field combo,
is value set/not set correctly?

== PACKAGING

Check packaging guidelines:

  http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?QuickGuideToPackaging

- ri docs during install?

- html docs during install?


== FEATURES

- conversion to/from hcard/hevent

- don't encode TYPE= if there are no values

- complete RRULE support

- icalendar maker

- rrule maker

- valarms

  - like ones that open apps: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=300368

- add way to delete a param from a Field, maybe assign nil to it? done?


== Future Development

- streaming decoder?

- streaming encoder?


== QUESTIONS

- What does Time.local do with the isdst, and tz arguments?

- Time.local()/gm() don't raise errors for out-of-range day-of-month (Feb 31st,
  anyone?)!

- Ask about Date extensions?

- Ask about Time extensions?

+ Ask on ietf-icalendar:

  Errors in examples?

  RFC error - CATEGORY is used in an example, it should be CATEGORIES



== CLEANUPS/BUGS

- perfect round trip decode/encode - make Field take the entire line, with
	embedded newlines?

I need to keep my own date/time, and not use Time as the basic object in my iteration.

Then, I can eliminate non-existent times before yielding them.

- the rrule tests depended on being in EST/EDT, so no longer pass...

- when encoding a Date or Time, set value=date/value=date-time parameter?

- allow preferred to be set to false/nil in vcard/maker

- Need to deal with Date and Time comparisons, see note in time_from_rfc2425. I
  might need to extend the date time comparisons so Date and Time can be
  compared.

- Vevent has @fields, and @properties, but @properties has @fields, too.
  Duplication necessary?

- I could do this entirely differently, by adding a to_rfc2445 method to Date,
  Time, DateTime, etc. that return string values, then anybody could add their
  own values, and we'd handle it. But then, what about setting the value type?
  Maybe some kind of table of handlers, per class?

- Time#plusmonth/day should ask itself if it is in utc, then call Time.utc or Time.local
  as appropriate.

- bug: deal with "round down" that Date does when you add a month, and the dofmonth is not
  in valid range -> if you have jan31 repeating monthly with iCal, you shouldn't get an
  occurence in Feb

- do coverage testing: http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=18&release_id=360

- deal with timezones correctly, iCalendar wants:

     DTSTART:19970714T133000                  ;Local time
     DTSTART:19970714T173000Z                 ;UTC time
     DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19970714T133000  ;Local time and time zone reference

  Done?

- don't allow quoted-printable encodings if version is 3.0

- encoding values with a \n in it will break

  --> generally, make sure not to generate invalid encodings

- return self for true, and for methods that don't have other return values?

- preserve whitespace in a Field?

- value=text
  in this value, newlines are \n or \N, deal with this when decoding
  (as are ; and ,)

- freeze everything? -> Need to test this.

== JR

Examples don't run!


== VCARD VERSION INTEROP

- Confirm Address Book bugs: PHOTO uses version 2 encoding field, and has too many spaces.

- Examine vCard 2.1 interop, and possible trans-encoding.

  - ; can show up in a parameter value, if escaped

  - quoted-printable can be used to encode values with line breaks

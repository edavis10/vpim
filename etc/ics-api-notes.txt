props and params with lists of values use ,

properties with multiple parts (as opposed to a list of values), use ;

property params with values containg ":", ",", or ";" must be placed in quoted text

property param values cannot contain '"'

property param values not in quoted strings are case insensitive...

two forms of mult-valued properties:

"," seperated values of a single property

new content line for each value


API should perhaps hide this difference? Also, some properties docs prefer
one or the other of the forms.


All iCal parameters are documented in RFC2445s4.2. Variations:

param-value

DQUOTE value DQUOTE *( "," DQUOTE value DQUOTE )

List of case-insensitive token: "ACCEPTED", .., x-name, iana-token

paramtext

Some have refererences to property value types.


value parameter must be speced if property value is not of the default type
for that property.

Not too long a list of property value types, see RFC2445s4.3:

"BINARY"
/ "BOOLEAN"
/ "CAL-ADDRESS"
/ "DATE"
/ "DATE-TIME"
/ "DURATION"
/ "FLOAT"
/ "INTEGER"
/ "PERIOD"
/ "RECUR"
/ "TEXT"
/ "TIME"
/ "URI"
/ "UTC-OFFSET"


Components and their allowed/required/etc. properties are described in RFC2445s4.6.

Values and semantics of property values are in 4.7 and 4.8.

Allowed property values can vary depending on the calendar component they are
used within, or at least STATUS can.

Property spec includes expect value type, as well as allowed parameters.


Also, there are inter-related "hooks" for propetries, such as the list of
properties that cause the SEQUENCE property to be incrmented whenever one of
those properties are changed.


Should be able to parse the examples in s5.

Rrule

Shouldn't this be under Icalendar?

Also, I think it needs to take DTEND and/or DURATION as an arg, or in Vevent,
both #dtend and #duration need to take an optional +ytime+, so you can find
the how long each occurence is.

		  (dtstart is required for VEVENT, different criteria by component)

#duration
n:0-1
#value    special format... currently return seconds, but that is only
with respect to the specific occurence. Perhaps it should take an
arg, where it's arg is start time. Default is DTSTART, but if you
want to know the duration of each occurence, you can ask with the
new start time. Or does Rrule already handle this?

note: either DTEND or DURATION, but not both

#description/#location/#summary
n:0-1
#value    TEXT

Deal with altrep by having #description_altrep, etc, returning a URI

#status

#transp

#uid

#url

if it has a to_str or to_s method

#recurid

#value    DATE-TIME, or optionally DATE
param VALUE
param TZID supported?

Should be a class, and it has tons of special handling... deal with later
if I ever do iTIP.

		could use special handing:

		  --> type should be components, that I look up by UID

  #rrule
	#rdate
	  ... both may occur multiple times, how to handle? I think
		I need a #recurrences that returns an object that has all the
		rrules, rdates, and exceptional conditions in it, and returns
		them in sorted order....

		Not trivial! Definitely could use some test code.


; the following are optional, ; and MAY occur more than once
	x-prop
	 
	 Give access to the underlying fields if they want to do something special.

	
For multi-valued properties where it might be useful to have access to the
params, sometime, I could do #comments(detailed=false) where detailed returns
objects if its needed. In the meantime, there's always the dirinfo APIs.

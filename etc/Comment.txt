* The meaning of "Z" and of the time-zone offset is never defined

I assume that the +/- form has the same definition as RFC822, what is the "Z"?

* why is there no value=image? This would seem to be particularly useful for PHOTO...

* Errors in the definition of time:

  time-secfrac = "," 1*DIGIT

This, if true, means that the time-list would be ambiguous:

  time-list = time *("," time)

But luckily (...?!) it conflicts with the examples given:

  Examples for "time": 
    10:22:00.33
    10:22:00.33Z


* Errors in the samples

From Example 3 (8.3) in RFC 2425:

  email;internet:mb@goerlitz.de

The second would appear to be *both* syntactically invalid (no "=", see below),
and not a valid RFC 2426 EMAIL parameter.


From Example 2 (8.2) in RFC 2425:

  ...
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: Quoted-Printable

  begin:VCARD
  source:ldap://cn=bjorn%20Jensen, o=university%20of%20Michigan, c=US

This is obviously not quoted-printable (since =bj is not valid) it's just 7bit.
If it was quoted-printable, "cn=bjorn" would be "cn=3dbjorn".


The vcards also don't have a VERSION field, making them non-rfc2426 compliant.



* Differences between 2.1 and 3.0 that aren't mentioned, or are an RFC 2426 EBNF error

Rfc2425 neglects to mention as a difference that multiple group names
are allowed in vCard 2.1, but not vCard 3.0 (RFC 2425).

Or is this an error in the RFC2426 EBNF?

vCard 2.1:

  groups		= groups "." word / word
  item		= [groups "."] name [params] ":" value CRLF

vCard 3.0/RFC 2426:

   contentline  = [group "."] name *(";" param ) ":" value CRLF
   group        = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")





* params without values are allowed, but not without an "="

param = param-name "=" param-value *("," param-value)
param-value  = ptext / quoted-string
ptext  = *SAFE-CHAR

So

field;toggle:value

is invalid, but

field;toggle=:value
field;toggle=,,:value

are valid? Is this really the intention?

* no DQUOTE in parameter values

parameter values appear not to be able to contain a DQUOTE, even
escaped. So:

name;param="..\"..":value

is invalid. This surprised me, I'd assumed that that quoting would be
possible. I'm not complaining, it makes the syntax simpler, was it
intended? I'm not missing something, am I?

This is a pure-ruby library for decoding and encoding vCard and iCalendar data
("personal information") called vPim.

vCard (RFC 2426) is a format for personal information, see Vpim::Vcard and
Vpim::Maker::Vcard.

iCalendar (RFC 2445) is a format for calendar related information, see
Vpim::Icalendar.

vCard and iCalendar support is built on top of an implementation of the MIME
Content-Type for Directory Information (RFC 2425). The basic RFC 2425 format is
implemented by  Vpim::DirectoryInfo and Vpim::DirectoryInfo::Field.

The libary is quite useable, but there is always more that could be done.
Since I have a more on my todo list than I have time, if you think something
is missing or have API suggestions, please contact me. I can't promise
instantaneous turnaround, but I might be able to suggest another approach,
and features requested by users of vPim go to the top of the todo list.

= Examples

Examples of using vPim are provided in samples/.

vCard examples are:
- link:ex_mkvcard.txt: example of creating a vCard
- link:ex_cpvcard.txt: example of copying and them modifying a vCard
- link:ex_mkv21vcard.txt: example of creating version 2.1 vCard
- link:mutt-aliases-to-vcf.txt: convert a mutt aliases file to vCards
- link:ex_get_vcard_photo.txt: pull photo data from a vCard
- link:ab-query.txt: query the OS X Address Book to find vCards
- link:vcf-to-mutt.txt: query vCards for matches, output in formats useful
  with Mutt (see link:README.mutt for details)
- link:tabbed-file-to-vcf.txt: convert a tab-delimited file to vCards, a
  (small but) complete application contributed by Dane G. Avilla, thanks!
- link:vcf-to-ics.txt: example of how to create calendars of birthdays from vCards
- link:vcf-dump.txt: utility for dumping contents of .vcf files

iCalendar examples are:
- link:ics-to-rss.txt: prints todos as RSS, or starts a WEBrick servlet
  that publishes todos as a RSS feed. Thanks to Dave Thomas for this idea,
  from http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Blog/ToDos.rdoc.
- link:cmd-itip.txt: prints emailed iCalendar invitations in human-readable
  form, and see link:README.mutt for instruction on mutt integration. I get
  a lot of meeting invitations from Lotus Notes/Domino users at work, and
  this is pretty useful in figuring out where and when I am supposed to be.
- link:reminder.txt: prints upcoming events and todos, by default from
  Apple's iCal calendars
- link:rrule.txt: utility for printing recurrence rules
- link:ics-dump.txt: utility for dumping contents of .ics files
module Vpim

= Installation

There is a vPim package installable using ruby-gems.

It is also installable in the standard way. Untar the package, and see:

  ruby install.rb --help

or do:

  $ ruby install.rb config

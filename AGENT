== Platypus feedback

- executable bit should be set on script

- selecting a folder to be added to the resource file seems to have the
  side-effect of making the .app get generated into that folder

- how does script know the location of the .app or it's Resources folder?

    From $0

- custom icon doesn't make it into the shell command to create the app?


To use the tool it's preferred that you supply images at four different
resolutions: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128. But, you can create a .icns file
with as little as one image. Apple's help on this subject states: "If you give
IconComposer only one image, it should be optimized to look best at 128x128
pixels. This ensures it looks goods when displayed at the maximum resolution of
128x128 pixels, and looks acceptable when scaled down to the smaller
resolutions."

Regarding image formats you can supply, the help system also states:
"IconComposer can create icons from the following image formats: GIF, JPEG,
PDF, PICT, PNG, TIFF, and any of the QuickTime-supported image formats."

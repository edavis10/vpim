      WHERE HAVE ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE GONE? WHY SAN FRANCISCO IS LOSING ITS YOUNG WORKERS AND FAMILIES
      
      
      
      
      According to a recent survey from the Mayor&#39\;s Office\, nearly half the families in San Francisco with preschool children stated their intent to move out in the next three years\, citing the lack of affordable housing and the state of the public schools as primary motivators. The findings confirm what many have known for a long time - with the highest median home prices of any major U.S. city and the smallest share of children under age 18\, San Francisco has a hard time attracting and retaining young workers and families. What is the city doing to improve affordable housing\, job growth and the quality of public schools? Our panel will discuss what is needed to allow young residents and families to stay in San Francisco for the long term.

SUMMARY:The Evolution and Future of Micropayments
DESCRIPTION:Micropayments are a $354 billion industry. And according to analysts\, its only just begun its hypergrowth phase.
      
      Our experienced Executive Panel will analyze and comment on the evolution of micropayments. The HBSTech perspective will be to analyze the value chain\, the impact on new business models and evolving technologies.
      
      In 2005\, consumers generated $354 billion in transactions under $1. These transactions\, if processed by traditional credit card companies\, would typically cost a merchant 25 cents plus 2% of the transaction. On a one dollar transaction\, a merchant would be left with only 70 cents. According to a recent research study by the Tower Group\, the total US micropayments industry will increase from $2 billion in 2004 to over $15 billion in 2008
      
      New models of processing micropayments are emerging\, and can be categorized into the following models: 
      
      *
      Direct to Bill - payments are billed monthly to a consumers bill\, used primarily in mobile telecom. Cell providers have been somewhat reluctant to adopt this model because of fraud\, disputed transactions and back-end payments.
      *
      Merchant Aggregation  small charges are grouped together and submitted as a single transaction.
      *
      Prepaid Accounts  accounts which are pre-funded by a customer.
      *
      Direct Transfer  a users bank or other account is directly accessed to pull the necessary funds.
      *
      Subscription Model  users are charged a monthly or annual fee for unlimited or limited access to products. Conversion rates on this model are low given the uncertainty of customer usage.
      
      A key growth area for micropayments is in mobile commerce. In the past\, mobile content grew at a slow pace due to outdated billing systems and a lack of payment standards\, which made security and payment authorization a challenge. Additionally few cellular operators have built the back office and billing infrastructure to capture this revenue\, reconcile it\, and handle the settlement process.
      
      Another key challenge for micropayments is that consumers continue to expect internet content to be free of charge and particularly do not want to pay for incremental content. The change in telephone rates from pennies-per-minute to flat rate pricing demonstrates this trend. Younger consumers who may not necessarily have a credit or debit card have increasingly driven the growth of smaller purchases\, particularly via the internet and through cell phones. 
      
      Brian Jaffe\, a fifteen year veteran of the financial services industry\, is the Producer and Moderator for this event. Brian (HBS 1988) is currently the SVP Sales and Marketing for Suni Medical Imaging. The esteemed panel includes Executives from:

SUMMARY:socialwork: gifts\, exchanges\, and other projects
DESCRIPTION:The collection of video\, sculpture\, photography\, performance and other documents in Sara Thachers solo exhibition\, Socialwork\, explores what it means for an artist to have a public voice and what the public has to say back. Thacher picks at the edges of public life and creates a dialog with her audience and those who participate in her projects. One piece\, Fourteen Miles in Other Peoples Shoes (http://borro.ws/shoes)\, begins as a literal enactment of a clichéd phrase and becomes a serious tool for social intervention. Wearing another person&#39\;s shoes as your own is a very intimate gesture on many levels for both parties.
      
      That spirit of intimacy also permeates BART Sleeps (http://borro.ws/BARTsleeps)\, a pillow-lending program enacted on the Bay Areas commuter trains. Thacher cast herself in the role of the BART Sleeps Facilitator\, offering pillows with fresh pillowcases to anyone who wanted a more comfortable ride. These and other projects bring this investigation of exchange into the gallery\, providing opportunities for visitors to become collaborators.
      
      Socialwork opens on April 7th at Ego Park\, 492 23rd St. (at Telegraph)\, Oakland. Stop by the reception from 7 to 10 pm and have a banana\, pre-sliced from the inside (all you need to do is peel it!).

SUMMARY:6th Annual Berkeley in Silicon Valley Symposium
DESCRIPTION:http://www.coe.berkeley.edu/bisv/
      
       Global Competition: How We Can Win
      
      A. Richard Newton
      Successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur\, world-renowned in silicon chip design automation and dean of the College of Engineering\, UC Berkeley
      
      In his recent best selling book\, The World is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century\, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Thomas Friedman writes that the lowering of trade and political barriers and profound technological advances in global connectivity have enabled a &quot\;flat world&quot\; where it is possible to do business or almost anything else instantaneously and with billions of people. According to Dean Richard Newton\, it is perhaps ironic that this global &quot\;flattening&quot\; has actually made local regions\, like Silicon Valley and the Bay Area\, even more important. In many ways\, Silicon Valley can be seen as a new and emerging &quot\;corporation&quot\; in its own right\, with all of us who live and work here as its employees creating a &quot\;bump&quot\; on Friedman&#39\;s flat world.
      
      Come talk with Dean Newton as he poses important questions about the role Berkeley Engineering and the Silicon Valley can play in growing our regional advantage\, and how we can inspire and promote a more competitive future for our children and grandchildren here in California.
      
      The registration fee includes an hors d&#39\;oeuvres and wine reception. Space is limited so please register online now.
      
          * $50 for the general public
          * $25 for UC Berkeley Engineering alumni
          * $15 for UC Berkeley Engineering alumni from 1995 - 2005.

DESCRIPTION:Panelists: Neil Hunt\, Netflix\; Tom Conrad\, Pandora\; Dave Porter\, Live365\; Rashmi Sinha\, Moderator. More panelists to be announced.
      
      Description: Recently\, there have been several exciting developments in using social search and personalization to help users find information. The more interesting developments have to do with recommendations based on personal tastes\, social trends\, tags\, ratings\, popularity\, and friends tastes. All these methods go beyond the classic search paradigm of relevance and flat lists of results\, resulting in different types of user experience challenges. This panel will explore some recent trends in this area by bringing together panelists from Netflix\, Live365 and Pandora.

SUMMARY:The Attack on Scientific Thinking and Why We Must Defend Science
DESCRIPTION:In the United States today science\, as science\, is under attack as never before. The attacks are coming at an accelerating pace\, and include frequent interventions by powerful forces\, in and out of the Bush Administration\, who seem all too willing to deny scientific truths\, disrupt scientific investigations\, block scientific progress\, undermine scientific education\, and sacrifice the very integrity of the scientific process itself. We must refuse to accept a situation where scientific inquiry is blocked or its findings ruled out of order unless they conform to the goals of the government\, to corporate interests and to the ideology of religious fundamentalists\; where dogma enforced by governmental and religious authority takes the place of science\; where the scientific approach of seeking natural explanations for natural phenomena is suppressed.
      
      The scientists speaking on these attacks include (More to be announced) :
      
      Kevin Padian  professor of Integrative Biology and curator of the Museum of Paleontology at UC Berkeley. Kevin is the President of the National Center for Science Education.
      
      Phil Plait  NASA Education Resource Director (NERD) in the department of Physics and Astronomy at Sonoma State University. He is the creator of the website\, badastronomy.com\, where he fights myths and misconceptions people have about astronomy.
      
      Michael G. Hadfield\, panel moderator  professor of Zoology and director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory at the University of Hawaii.
      
      
      Hosted by the Berkeley chapter of Defend Science!        students@defendscience.org
      
      Defend Science! recognizes the serious danger posed to society and humanity if science is the attacks on science are not defeated. We aim to rally a broad movement to defend science and scientific thinking. Please read and circulate the Defend Science Statement (defendscience.org)\, help us print it in newspapers from the USA Today to the Kansas City Star. and join with us in waging this urgent battle.

SUMMARY:Benefit film screening: "INDEPENDENT AMERICA: The Two-Lane Search for Mom & Pop"
DESCRIPTION:These days\, you have to go pretty far out of your way to spend your money in an local &quot\;mom and pop&quot\; store instead of one of the thousands of national corporate chains that seem to be sprouting up in every city in America\, and increasingly overseas\, too. One couple has taken that notion a little bit farther  13\,000 miles farther\, to be exact.
      
      In their new documentary\, &quot\;INDEPENDENT AMERICA: The Two-Lane Search for Mom & Pop&quot\;\, award-winning journalists Hanson Hosein and Heather Hughes took the roads less traveled to uncover the growing opposition to corporate franchises and big box retailers across the U.S.\, and the David vs. Goliath fight that local small businesses are being forced to wage to stay alive.
      
      
      The film is an account of the former TV reporters 52-day\, 32-state road trip in search of unchained&quot\; America. They have only two self-imposed rules: 1) no interstate highways\, and 2) no corporate chains  including gas stations\, restaurants\, hotels\, and grocery stores. In other words\, they can only shop with mom and pop.
      
      What they discover during their trip is growing discontent with corporate America\, and a growing movement away from globalization and toward re-localization\, as individuals and small businesses across the country band together to preserve not only their livelihoods\, but their local communities as well.
      
      
      In Colorado\, a Starbucks is repeatedly vandalized. In Texas\, a rebellious city forces Borders Books into retreat. Residents of Americas Fourth of July capital in Nebraska turn against their new Wal-Mart. And an entire Wyoming town goes into business for itself after it is abandoned by its one chain department store. 
      
      Along the way\, their conversations with corporate executives\, economists\, entrepreneurs\, political leaders\, union members\, and ordinary Americans from all walks of life lead Hosein and Hughes to conclude that a healthy democracy needs local small businesses if it wants to control ever-growing corporate power.
      
      
      The 80-minute film will be followed by a panel discussion. Tickets are $5  $10\, and go on sale 30 minutes before the show. Proceeds benefit the 2006 CounterCorp Film Festival in October. For more information about the film screening or the CounterCorp festival\, visit www.countercorp.org.

SUMMARY:Crooners & Songbirds: Saucy and Sauced!
DESCRIPTION:Crooners & Songbirds is a monthly cabaret focusing on vocal jazz\, blues and popular music from the &#39\;20s and &#39\;30s. Prepare to tap your toes and get runs in your hose as Megan Lynch scorches the torch songs and gets saucy\, Tony Marcus caresses his archtop guitar into sweet submission\, Kelly McCubbin shows you the dark side of ukulele\, and Amy Z wrestles the saw even more melodically and provocatively than Marlene Dietrich did.
      
      * <a href="http://sanfrancisco.tribe.net/recommendation/Megan-Lynch/san-francisco-city/3fcae40a-ded9-47b9-8ef1-5dd5a9e69a12">Megan Lynch</a> has <a href="http://www.myspace.com/meganlynch">crooned\, warbled\, belted\, and yodeled</a> at Crooners & Songbirds\, Bijou\, Mighty\, Noe Valley Ministry and other establishments where they serve fine tarts.
      
      * <a href="http://www.tuxedorecords.com/TM/index.html">Tony Marcus</a> has performed music from Dublin to Yokohama and from Alaska to Florida. Bands he has played with include R. Crumb & the Cheap Suit Serenaders\, Cats & Jammers\, Geoff Muldaur&#39\;s Fountain of Youth\, The Arkansas Sheiks\, The Royal Society Jazz Orchestra\, and The Frank Wakefield Band. He currently also performs with Patrice Haan as Leftover Dreams.

      borders. Kelly plays favorites from the 20s\, 30s and other popular decades.
      If you&#39\;ve always wanted to hear Cliff Edwards segued into Billy Squire\, this
      is the uke player for you!
      
      * Amy Zing has always loved shiny and dangerous things\, and on that fateful
      day in the hardware store\, when her eyes landed on Stella\, funny ideas began
      to bubble in her brain. Liberating each other from lives of mundane utility\,
      they&#39\;ve both learned to appreciate the beauty hidden under the rust.
      
      NOTE: Crooners & Songbirds is at a new venue for this month.

SUMMARY:SF Bay Area Cohousing Bus Tour
DESCRIPTION:A personal visit to a variety of cohousing communities offers you an experience that no photo\, website or book can offer. To provide you with this opportunity\, the Cohousing Association of the United States (Coho/US) sponsors daylong tours of cohousing communities in several areas around the nation.
      
      An experienced cohouser or cohousing professional will take you to visit five to seven communities. As you travel between locations on a comfortable bus\, the tour leader will give participants a chance to introduce themselves\, share general information about cohousing\, answer questions\, provide fact sheets and site plans\, and prepare you for your 40-minute visit to each community.
      
      At each stop\, a community host (often a long-time resident) will guide your group through his or her neighborhood and answer questions. Mid-day\, you will receive a gourmet box lunch or a meal prepared in one of the common houses.
      
      http://www.cohousing.org/tours.aspx
      
      This particular tour will visit Sonoma County (Two Acre Wood in Sebastopol\, Frog Song Cohousing in Cotati and Yulupa Cohousing in Santa Rosa) in the morning\, and Pleasant Hill\, Berkeley\, Doyle Street (Emeryville) and Swan&#39\;s Market Cohousing (Oakland) in the afternoon. The tour begins and ends at Swans Market Cohousing\, 930 Clay Street\, downtown Oakland.

      SDForum&#39\;s Start-up SIG features a fabulous double-hitter: founders from OddPost and WordPress. Speakers: Toni Schneider\, Oddpost&#39\;s CEO before its acquisition by Yahoo\, & now Automattic&#39\;s CEO\; Iain Lamb\, Oddpost co-founder\; & Matt Mullenweg\, Automattic (WordPress) co-founder.

SUMMARY:PDMA: Qualifying New Product Opportunities
DESCRIPTION:http://www.norcalpdma.org
      
      Technology based companies frequently have more ideas than they do resources to develop them and take them to market. In this situation\, it is critical to quickly determine which new product opportunities are worth pursuing and which should be shelved. The key to successful prioritization is gathering data from the marketplace quickly and effectively\, thus allowing a decision to move ahead on projects with a higher likelihood of success. This discussion will include an introduction to a proven technique called Opportunity Analysis\, an approach that has been used by successful Fortune 100 companies\, and a case study from a successful nanotech company. 
      
      Key takeaways include: 
      * Framing and documenting your ideas 
      * Selecting which ideas to pursue and portfolio management 
      * Methods and procedures for qualifying the opportunity through customer interviews and data gathering 
      * Worksheets and templates that you can use in your own company 
      
      Presenters: 
      Lynne Galligan\, Managing Director - Hilltop Innovation 
      Lynne founded Hilltop Innovation in 2002 to help growth oriented companies improve their success rate in new product development. 
      
      Prior to starting Hilltop\, Lynne was Chief Technology Officer and Vice President\, Business Development for Avery Dennison Corporation. Before joining Avery in 1997\, Lynne was Director of Chemistry and Environmental Sciences at Corporate Research and Development for General Electric. 
      
      Lynne began her career in the product development group at Dow Corning in 1977 where she held various technology and business roles before leaving in 1994 to join a Dow start-up\, Dendritech. Lynne received a BS in Chemistry from Western Washington University\, MS in Inorganic Chemistry from The University of Illinois and an MBA in Marketing from Central Michigan University.

SUMMARY:Distributed Whitehead Network Symposium
DESCRIPTION:Anglo-American philosopher and mathematician\, Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947) has long been regarded as one of the major philosophers of the twentieth century\; nevertheless\, with the exception of proponents of process philosophy (process metaphysics)\, his speculative philosophy of organism fell out of favor with the ascendance of more (or very differently) linguistically-oriented analytic and continental philosophies int he 1950s and 1960s. For several reasons the past decade has witnessed a rekindling of interest in Whitehead&#39\;s elaborate account of the complexly imbricated operations of mental and physical processes.
      
      This is the inaugural event of Distributed Whitehead Network and will feature a panel focusing on essays by Isabelle Stengers (&quot\;Whitehead&#39\;s Account of the Sixth Day&quot\;) and respondents Richard Rorty and Donna Haraway.
      
      In addition to the live session\, a webcast will provide an opportunity for individuals around the globe to participate. Please see the website for additional information.

In addition to paid sponsor exhibits\, the Be-In each year invites a range of groups whose causes or products are worthy of broader exposure. The Green Frontier is a lively forum where leading technology creators can meet and exchange ideas with sophisticated users and professionals. It is also a place to expose forward-thinking ideas and initiatives to a community that is in the business of changing the world through evolutionary technology and social innovations. The Digital Be-In is well known as a catalyst to influence trends\, spawn important ideas\, create alliances\, and showcase creative possibilities. The Green Frontierat the event and on the ongoing Be-In websitesis where the tribes gather and connect.

SUMMARY:Silicon Valley Ruby Conference
DESCRIPTION:http://www.sdforum.org/rubyreg
      
      This is a two day conference April 22 - 23\, 2006.
      
      In the last five years\, software development has undergone a dramatic shift away from statically-typed\, compiled languages and towards more dynamic languages like Perl\, Python\, and Ruby.
      
      In the past year Ruby on Rails- a framework for quickly building highly interactive and robust web applications-has become the single most talked about framework in software. Rails also features built-in support for Ajax\, which is the technology that provides the revolutionary rich user experience behind Google Maps\, A9 and Writely.
      
      If you&#39\;re a software developer who&#39\;s curious about the cutting edge and wondering what the noise is all about\, SDForum and Ruby Central invite you to spend two days drinking from a ruby-colored firehose.
      
      Learn from the Early Adopters. New technologies involve risk\, pain\, and a learning curve. Avoid the most disastrous mistakes\, and learn how to quickly reap compelling benefits by learning from the people who&#39\;ve been there. 
      
      Understand the Enthusiasm. Experience the power of Ruby first-hand. Spend two days immersed in the world of Ruby and then decide for yourself. 
      
      Hear From Founders who are Risking it All. Thinking about a new startup? Wondering if Ruby makes sense for you? Hear from founders who decided to bet the farm on Ruby.
      
      Topics and Speakers
      (Check website often for updates)
      
      * Test Driven Development in Ruby and Rails using Zen Test - Ryan Davis
      * Rails 1.1 - Marcel Molina

SUMMARY:SEARCHING WITHIN\, a Free 9-Week Course
DESCRIPTION:The Searching Within course explains about the use of self-knowledge and how to truly know oneself. This\, according to ancient spiritual traditions\, is the way to acquire true wisdom. We can learn about the amazing potential each person has for change. See for yourself how and where to begin\, discovering the ability to respond to life and others with greater clarity and intelligence - and activate the spiritual part within. Through investigating the causes of suffering\, depression\, anxiety and all the problems in life\, learn about overcoming them and finding the source of true peace and wisdom.
      Over the 9 weeks you can learn how to:
      
      activate Awareness and consciousness
      
      see the causes of problems and negativity 
      
      observe within yourself 
      
      interpret your dreams and use them for self-discovery 
      
      improve your relationships 
      
      develop intuition 
      
      overcome problems with drugs\, alcohol\, and addictions 
      
      bring order to your life 
      Why free?
      You might be wondering why we offer a 9-week course free of charge. The philosophy behind our school is simply that spiritual knowledge cannot be bought or sold\; it is given to people for free and should be passed to others in the same way\, so that no one is excluded from receiving it and benefiting from its life changing effects.

SUMMARY:2006 Startup School
DESCRIPTION:Are you a hacker who has thought about one day starting a startup? Then you&#39\;re invited to a free\, one-day startup school this April 29 at Stanford.
      
      We&#39\;ll have a range of experts speaking on all the things you need to know to start a company: what makes a good startup idea and where to get them\; what to look for in a co-founder\; how to get angel and VC funding\; how to incorporate a company and what agreements founders should have among themselves\; when and how to apply for patents\; what can go wrong in a startup\; what acquirers look for\; and how the acquisition process works.
      
      One day is not enough to cover all these topics thoroughly\, but we think we&#39\;ll be able to cover enough to make it clear how startups work. Most hackers probably consider starting a company at some point\, but are put off because &quot\;business&quot\; seems a mystery. Our goal is to remove that mystery.

SUMMARY: Internet Identity Workshop
DESCRIPTION:The Internet Identity Workshop focuses on user-centric identity and identity in the large. Providing identity services between people\, websites\, and organizations that don&#39\;t necessarily have a formalized relationship is a different problem than providing authentication and authorization services within a single organization.
      
      The goal of the Internet Identity Workshop is to support the continued development of several open efforts in the user-centric identity community. These include the following:
      
          * Technical systems and proposal like Yadis (LID\, OpenID\, Inames)\, MetaIdentity system\, Infocards\, and the Higgings Project
          * Legal and social movements and issues like Identity Commons\, identity rights agreements\, and service providers reputation.
          * Use cases for emerging markets such as user generated video (e.g. dabble.com)\, innovative economic networks (e.g. interraproject.org)\, attention brokering and lead generation (e.g. root.net)\, consumer preferences (e.g. permission based marketing)\, and civil society networking
      
      The workshop will take place May 2 and 3\, 2006 at the Computer History Museum. We will also have a 1/2 day on the first of May for newbies who want to get oriented to the protocols and issues before diving into the community. If you are new to the discussion\, we encourage your attendance on May 1st because of the open format we&#39\;ll be using to organize the conference.

      Finding Mercury Bio:
      FINDINGMERCURY is the alternative rock synthesis of four musicians. Their influences range from mainlanders like Switchfoot to Brit-Rock phenoms like Cold Play\, Muse\, and Delirious. FMs music is highly electric\, emotionally profound\, and full of hooks. The band makes a matchless contribution to their genre because of their unique yet complementary backgrounds in rock\, pop/punk\, fusion\, classical and funk. When someone said\, FINDINGMERCURY is a musical band\, it was in appreciation of the artists individual contributions to the group sound.
      
      FINDINGMERCURY is currently packing its schedule with promotional events to get their music out to the people. For starters\, FINDINGMERCURY is aggressively touring Northern California where they have been building a local fan base from Santa Rosa to San Francisco to Sacramento and Reno. One can find this tight-knit band playing with internationally acclaimed groups such as Lava/Atlantic Records artist Skillet\, Epic Records artists &#39\;Justin King&#39\; and with local rising starsAn Opiate for Angels. Additionally\, FMs promotional work includes the release of first\, a self titled EP in May of 05 with L.A. producers--Chris Julian (Billy Idol\, Queen Latifah) and Robert Vaughn (Mint and Sister Gypsy) and then\, the release of their Debut Albumtitled Vehicle with Transitmusics Ken Abellon\; this new album is an inspiring example for listeners of their prolific sound.
      
      FINDINGMERCURY vowed to let nothing divert energy from their driving passion to create live music that blows unsullied creativity back into the mind of each listener. Jesse Garcia of Building 429 says\, After sharing the stage with these guys\, I was blown away by the many colorings in the music and it translates amazingly well on their new album Vehicle. FINDINGMERCURY is a must see live performance. Their music exudes vulnerability while being an emotional and electric experience for all!

SUMMARY:MeshForum 2006\,Connecting Networks

In a single\, highly participatory track\, panels of experts and select speakers will cover topics from summarizing current academic research to techniques for navigating and activating networks in specific industries.

SUMMARY:DESTROYER\, HUDSON BELL
DESCRIPTION:Destroyers Rubies is a collection of shrewd pop music that takes no prisoners and asks no pardons. Equal parts cynicism\, disdain\, hope and humor\; self-referential\, self-mocking\, sagacious and coy. There is mythology here\, there is history\, there is heartbreak and there is triumph. Follow along as Bejar leaves his breadcrumb trail twisting through the crumbling forests and bleak landscapes of modern popular music. Its all heady and ecstatic. Trust him\, he has his reasons.
      
      Hudson Bell&#39\;s music and style\, while intrinsically rooted within the traditional American music of his childhood South\, traverses folk and rock in a way that bridges the gap between the country and the city. By way of acoustic and electric guitars\, piano/keyboards\, drums etc.\, the music comes off in a post-traditionaland make-and-do vein via the early-80&#39\;s punk and post-punk ethos. A fiction writer and storyteller as well\, Bell&#39\;s tunes are intertwined with compelling and poignant lyrics that pull the listener in as if they&#39\;re hearing a long lost friend.

SUMMARY:Santa Clara Valley Peace Officers Memorial Run
DESCRIPTION:The Santa Clara Valley Peace Officers Memorial Run organization sponsors a charitable fundraising motor ride event that honors peace officers who have sacrificed their lives while in the line of duty\, serving the citizens of Santa Clara County.
      
      Proceeds from the event provide support to the children and spouses of those officers who have fallen in the line of duty. In addition\, scholarships for deserving high school students in Santa Clara and San Benito Counties are awarded in honor and memory of those officers.
      
      The Memorial Run has fast become one of the largest motorcycle events in the Bay Area. The idea was conceived in June 2000\, and was organized by dedicated police personnel who volunteered their time. This first run was held on May 19\, 2001\, with approximately 800 bikes participating. The 2002 event had more than 1500 motorcycles\, and\, in 2003 and 2004\, the number doubled to more than 3000 bikes. The Memorial Run is still organized and operated entirely by volunteer police officers and non-sworn personnel.

SUMMARY:Reading: Capitola Book Cafe\, Capitola\,CA
DESCRIPTION:http://www.kingdomcoming.com/
      
      Michelle Goldberg reads from her new book\, Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism
      
      Michelle Goldberg\, a senior political reporter for Salon.com\, has been covering the intersection of politics and ideology for years. Before the 2004 election\, and during the ensuing months when many Americans were trying to understand how an administration marked by cronyism\, disregard for the national budget\, and poorly disguised self-interest had been reinstated\, Goldberg traveled through the heartland of a country in the grips of a fevered religious radicalism: the America of our time. From the classroom to the mega-church to the federal court\, she saw how the growing influence of dominionismthe doctrine that Christians have the right to rule nonbelieversis threatening the foundations of democracy.
      
      
      In Kingdom Coming\, Goldberg demonstrates how an increasingly bellicose fundamentalism is gaining traction throughout our national life\, taking us on a tour of the parallel right-wing evangelical culture that is buoyed by Republican political patronage. Deep within the red zones of a divided America\, we meet military retirees pledging to seize the nation in Christs name\, perfidious congressmen courting the confidence of neo-confederates and proponents of theocracy\, and leaders of federally funded programs offering Jesus as the solution to the countrys social problems.
      
      
      With her trenchant interviews and the telling testimonies of the people behind this movement\, Goldberg gains access into the hearts and minds of citizens who are striving to remake the secular Republic bequeathed by our founders into a Christian nation run according to their interpretation of scripture. In her examination of the ever-widening divide between believers and nonbelievers\, Goldberg illustrates the subversive effect of this conservative stranglehold nationwide. In an age when faith rather than reason is heralded and the values of the Enlightenment are threatened by a mystical nationalism claiming divine sanction\, Kingdom Coming brings us face to face with the irrational forces that are remaking much of America.
      
      
       Michelle Goldberg ventured into the heartland of American fundamentalist extremism -- and returned to warn us of the authoritarian ambitions that lie behind the moralistic posturing of the religious right.  Every patriot who still cherishes the freedoms we inherited from the nations founders should read her book.
      
       Joe Conason\, author of The Hunting of the President\, Big Lies\, and The Raw Deal
      
       
      Kingdom Coming reveals just how thoroughly our national discourse has been corrupted by the mad work of religious literalists.  Goldberg demonstrates  elegantly and persuasively that tens of millions of our neighbors are working each day to obliterate the separation between church and state\, to supplant scientific rationality with Iron Age fantasies\, and to achieve a Christian theocracy in the 21st century. This is a terrifying and necessary book.
      
      Sam Harris\, author\, The End of Faith

      Tomás Luis de Victoria (1548-1611)
      Francisco Guerrero (1528-1529)

      From the frightful sounds of the battlefield to impassioned pleas for God&#39\;s aid\, the 16th century&#39\;s conflict resonates today. Compsers Janequin\, Victoria\, Guerrero and Padilla brilliantly depict the timeless and tragic results of the quest for victory. The tensions and vibrancy of the era are evident in Missa Pro Victoria by Victoria and Guerreros Missa de la batalla escoutez\, both mass settings based on Jannequins chanson\, La Guerre.

SUMMARY:30th Annual San Francisco Free Folk Festival
DESCRIPTION:The San Francisco Free Folk Festival was conceived in 1976 by the San Francisco Folk Music Club\, which staged it for the first two years at the Hall of Flowers. It then moved to Fort Mason\, where it remained for 13 years\, before moving to the John Adams campus of City College until that venue became too small. Several years ago\, the festival moved to its current home at Roosevelt Middle School. We&#39\;ve been known to have between 2\,000 and 3\,000 guests attending the event. It takes about 200 volunteers to stage the Festival. 
      
      The festival was co-sponsored for many years by the San Francisco Folk Music Center / Plowshares Acoustic Music Center. We are also grateful for the support of our friends as KALW.
      
      While the festival would be a special event under any circumstances\, what makes it unique is the fact that it is an all-volunteer effort. Not only do members of the sponsoring organization - the San Francisco Folk Music Club serve as volunteer organizers\, but all performers and workshop leaders donate their time and talents to the festival as well.

SUMMARY:East Bay Cohousing Bus Tour
DESCRIPTION:A personal visit to a variety of cohousing communities offers you an experience that no photo\, website or book can offer. To provide you with this opportunity\, the Cohousing Association of the United States (Coho/US) sponsors daylong tours of cohousing communities in several areas around the nation.

      At each stop\, a community host (often a long-time resident) will guide your group through his or her neighborhood and answer questions. Mid-day\, you will receive a gourmet box lunch or a meal prepared in one of the common houses.

SUMMARY:Bioneers: Visionary and Practical Solutions for Restoring the Earth
DESCRIPTION:What is Bioneers?
      
      
      The Collective Heritage Institute\, aka Bioneers\, was founded by Kenny Ausubel in 1990. Bioneers was conceived to conduct educational and economic development programs in the conservation of biological and cultural diversity\, traditional farming practices\, and environmental restoration.
      
      Our vision of environment encompasses the natural landscape\, cultivated landscape\, biodiversity\, cultural diversity\, watersheds\, community economics\, and spirituality. Bioneers seeks to unite nature\, culture and spirit in an Earth-honoring vision\, and create economic models founded in social justice.
      
      Restoration addresses the premise that &quot\;sustainability&quot\; is problematic in the context of an environment that is already depleted. As Paul Hawken has noted\, sustainability is simply the midpoint between destruction and restoration. The goal of Bioneers is restoration\, addressing the interdependent array of economics\, jobs\, ecologies\, cultures\, and communities.
      
      Bioneers are biological pioneers who are working with nature to heal nature and ourselves. They have peered deep into the heart of living systems to devise strategies for restoration based on nature&#39\;s own operating instructions. They come from many cultures and perspectives\, and all walks of life.
      
      Bioneers are scientists and artists\, gardeners and economists\, activists and public servants\, architects and ecologists\, farmers and journalists\, priests and shamans\, policymakers and citizens. They are everyday people committed to preserving and supporting the future of life on Earth. They herald a dawning Age of Restoration founded in natural principles of kinship\, interdependence\, cooperation\, reciprocity\, and community.
      
      For a comprehensive overview of Bioneers&#39\; work in 2004\, download our annual report.
      
      Uniting nature\, culture\, and spirit\, Bioneers embody a change of heart - a spiritual connection with the living world that is grounded in social justice. Their pragmatic strategies effectively address many of our most pressing ecological and societal challenges.
      
      Above all\, Bioneers represent a culture of solutions. Their stories demonstrate that just as people have created the environmental and social problem we face\, people can solve them - through a reciprocal partnership with nature. Over and over\, they show how great a difference the actions of one individual can make.
